# Enhanced CineMatch: A Collaborative Filtering-Based Movie Recommendation System

Enhanced CineMatch is an improved version of the CineMatch recommendation algorithm, aimed at enhancing movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering techniques.

The primary goal of recommendation systems is to suggest relevant items to users based on their historical preferences and behavior. By leveraging the principles of collaborative filtering, Enhanced CineMatch predicts the ratings a user will give to a movie by considering similarities between users or items.
